# REST-API 
It stands for representational state transfer. It is used to exchange data between client and server, like sending and fetching data to and from server. Data mostly exchange in JSON format, but not mandatory

## REST and RESTful API
REST just defines a set of rules that says what it is to be a REST api, and a RESTfull service follows those rules.

## Dependencies to install:

* npm i –save-dev morgan (to show logs on terminal or console, not necessary)
* npm i multer (for files, images, like body parser)
* npm i express
* npm i –save-dev nodemon
* npm i mongoose
* npm i bcrypt (to hash passwords)
* npm i jsonwebtoken

**Postman is used to test all API**
